[**Tasmanian devils contagious cancers sequenced for first time**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01349-7)


Tasmanian devils are carnivorous marsupials in Australia. In the past decade, the population has decreased by 60-70% because of the transmissible facial cancers, DFTI1 and DFTI2. The cancers become infectious after 6-12 months post-bite. Genetic mapping can track DFTI1 back to 1986, and a superspreader passed DFTI1 to at least 6 other devils, resulting in 6 major variants of DFTI1. The devil population is resilient to DFTI1. On the other hand, DFTI2 is relatively new and emerged in 2011. The devil population is undergoing ongoing evaluation to resist the disease, which will select as-yet unknown traits in the host.
