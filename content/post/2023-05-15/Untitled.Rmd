[**Prized dinosaur fossil will finally be returned to Brazil**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01603-y)

Science colonialism is particularly prevalent in the field of paleontology. A notable example of this is the famous fossil that exhibits a feather-like structure in a non-avian dinosaur. In the 1990s, it was legally exported from Brazil to Germany. Brazilian researchers have been requesting the return of the fossil since 2020, when a publication based on it was released. Recently, German authorities have promised its return. However, this action seems to be driven by political power dynamics rather than scientific considerations. In my opinion, these resources should be governed by a neutral international organization that allows researchers to freely explore such specimens.
