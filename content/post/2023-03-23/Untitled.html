<p>(Abel Prize: pioneer of ’smooth’ physics wins top maths award)[<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00833-4" class="uri">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00833-4</a>]</p>
<p>Abel prize is the most coveted awards in mathematics and just announced the winner of this year (2023), Luis Caffarelli. He is a pioneer of smooth physics and offers a solution to describe the nature phenomena in equations, such as melting ice. The idea of this is regularity that avoids kinks and infinity in the equations. His collaborators said ‘ he has fantastic intuition’ that he can come up with idea from no where.</p>
