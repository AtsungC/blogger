<p>Perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl substances are used in various industries for their durability, such as waterproof cloth. However, the durability of these chemicals enables them to accumulate in the environment, even in the human body. This increases the risk of cancer. The US government (AWWA) has attempted to remove these substances from drinking water for years. The regulation is implemented from voluntarily to mandatorily. The cost of cleaning water will be expensive in the beginning and the industry will catch up the pace of regulation.</p>
