<p>The James Webb Space Telescope has only been in orbit for a year, yet it has already played a key role in space exploration. It is located near Earthâ€™s orbit but can provide more information about Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, than the Cassini spacecraft, which is closer to Saturn. Scientists have discovered possible signs of life on Enceladus, including a plume of icy water spraying from its surface and containing silica, which may originate from the churning of its icy bottom. These findings were spotted by the JWST in just a few minutes. There is much more to expect from the future of the JWST</p>
