[**Facelift for T.rex: analysis suggestes teeth were vovered by thin lips**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00928-y)


The image of Tyrannosaurus Rex is deeply rooted in Hollywood films, with a fearsome mouth and exposed dagger-like teeth. However, this may no longer hold true, as scientists have found that *T.rex*â€™s teeth only have a thin layer of enamel, which can cause cracking in a dehydrated environment. A close relative, the Komodo dragon, is an example of an reptile with teeth covered by thin enamel and protected by lips and scales. This suggests that *T.rex* might have had lips as well, but paleontological evidence is yet to be discovered.
