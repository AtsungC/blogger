<p>The image of Tyrannosaurus Rex is deeply rooted in Hollywood films, with a fearsome mouth and exposed dagger-like teeth. However, this may no longer hold true, as scientists have found that <em>T.rex</em>â€™s teeth only have a thin layer of enamel, which can cause cracking in a dehydrated environment. A close relative, the Komodo dragon, is an example of an reptile with teeth covered by thin enamel and protected by lips and scales. This suggests that <em>T.rex</em> might have had lips as well, but paleontological evidence is yet to be discovered.</p>
