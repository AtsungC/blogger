<p>Science often modifies natural methods to achieve scientific breakthroughs. One well-known example is the CRISPR-Cas system, which was originally used by bacteria to digest exogenous DNA. Recently, researchers discovered a syringe-like system in the resident bacteria P. asymbiotica of nematodes. This system can release toxins into the prey of nematodes via the syringe-like mechanism. It could potentially be used as a delivery system in medical research. One possible application could be in precision medicine, such as identifying cancer cells and delivering medication directly to them.</p>
