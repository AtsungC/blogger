## Resource:
[**Strife at *eLife*: inside a journal\'s quest to upend science publishing**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00831-6)


There is a new evolution in the scientific pressing system. The *eLite*, non-profit press, initiated the novel method. The manuscripts will not be rejected and instead be published with comments between editors and authors. The transformation should be taken cautiously. I see the benefits to the scientific community as the discussions will be open. This will be a learning material for young researchers. 

## Vocabulary

*relinquishing* the traditional journal role of gatekeeper. <br>
Academics were *lobbying* hard to get me fired.  <br>
If we want to fix a bad system, we do have to break some eggs.
