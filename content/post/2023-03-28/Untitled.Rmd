TRAPPIST-1b is located in a stellar system similar to Earth. Recently, data collected from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed the hypothesis that TRAPPIST-1b has no atmosphere. Despite being similar in size to Earth and orbiting a single star, TRAPPIST-1b receives four times more radiation from its star than Earth, which may have resulted in the loss of its atmosphere. Scientists have found that this planetary system is a valuable model for studying atmospheric formation in space laboratories.




## Vocabulary 

because it is **blasted** by four times as much radiation as Earth receives from the Sun <br>
potentially **scouring away** atmospheres <br>
