The issues of clean water and sanitation have been neglected for years in the UNâ€™s agenda. Extreme climate changes (above 1.5C before pre-industrial temperature) exacerbate these problems, especially in low-income countries, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South-Eastern Asia. The water conference is expected to be a platform for transboundary water  resources cooperation in the Middle East and North Africa, although the agreement is voluntary.
